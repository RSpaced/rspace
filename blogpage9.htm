<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">It's been a while, hasn't it?
Apologies for not posting as much - I want to keep these posts as high quality
as possible, and just writing random stuff <i>every</i> day might not work in
that sense. It'll probably still happen but just keep that in mind.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">Anyway, I'm sure you've heard
about the PSN (PlayStation Network) outage that happened a few days ago. All of
Sony's servers, yes, <i>all </i>of them, went completely offline. Now back in
2011 when the first outage happened it was pretty bad. For those of you unaware,
in 2011 a group of hackers effectively shut down the PSN servers and compromised
the personal data of 77.1 million PSN accounts.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">But even still people could
still play <i>most</i> of their games offline, meaning their expensive
PlayStation 3s and PSPs could still be used. Sure, no online services or
PlayStation Store for a bit, but at least you could play your games, right? Fast
forward to today. The PlayStation 5, Sony's newest console, is in approximately
65.5 million households (as of September 2024), and everything is going great;
New Triple-A games are releasing, Sony releases their newest VR headset (PSVR
2), and the sales numbers keep on rising.</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">But something is and has been
arising for a long time. Rewind back to the release of the PS4 and XBOX One.
Remember Microsoft's <i>disastrous</i> release where they said that your console
would have to be online at all times to play games? The year is 2013. People
were (rightly) not happy about this. What if I don't have internet or there's an
outage? My $499 console that I paid for will just become a paperweight?
&quot;Yes,&quot; Microsoft said with complete confidence. PlayStation users
scoffed at this. Sony (in a bit of clever marketing)&nbsp;revealed that the PS4
will be able to play games offline at any point (and more but that's not <i>entirely</i>
relevant to this currently)</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">So where are we now? When the
PSN servers went down earlier, you would assume it would be similar to what I've
explained before. But no. Everything stopped working. For at least a day, people
couldn't sign into PSN or access their profile, and worst of all, <i>couldn't
play any games</i>. &quot;But wait!&quot; You may say, &quot;I have the disc
version of my game so it should be fine!&quot;. And 10 years ago you'd be right.
But remember, the year is 2025, and the PS5 has to be connected. To. The.
INTERNET. To play your games, regardless of whether it's the physical or digital
versions. So of course, when the PSN went down, people found they couldn't open
games anymore.</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">So let me get this straight. Someone
could pay $600 for a console only for it to be a paperweight because some
servers stopped working? And not only that, you have to <i>pay</i> for
multiplayer online play?&nbsp;The unfortunate issue is that as consumers we've
gradually accepted the transition from owning software to software as a service
(i.e. predatory subscriptions which force you to pay more and more for something
you owned previously) and it's only gotten worse with AI.</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">Following this trend, when
the PS4 came out, PlayStation Plus (which existed prior only as a way to get
free games yearly) ended up with pay-to-play multiplayer. The PS4 already has a
Wi-Fi card. It's like buying a car and then the salesman telling you that while
the car <i>has </i>a speedometer, you can't use it unless you pay a monthly
subscription.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">The Nintendo Switch followed
this as well, but worse. When I got my Switch in May of 2018, I was stoked
because I could play Mario Kart 8 with my friends when we got home from school,
without needing to go to each other's houses. It was great and I was super happy
with my purchase... right up until they introduced Switch Online and paywalled
multiplayer along with other features. They literally took candy (online) from
babies (us) while they were still eating it by wrenching it out of their mouths
by force.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">Oh yeah, about the discs?
Sure, you can buy a game on a disc, but essentially it acts as a 'key' to run
the game. What's the point of using a high-density disc to hold game files if
the console downloads the whole game from the internet? The very fact that the
PS5 has to be connected to the internet to actually launch games defeats the
entire point of owning the game physically. The PS3, PSP and PS Vita were the
last of the PlayStation consoles to actually run the game straight from the disc
(or game card in the Vita's case) and it should have stayed that way.</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">The point is that hopefully
this PSN outage will be a wake-up call to the general public to put down
internet-connected games and streaming services, and start buying DVDs and Blu-Rays
again (I'll make a blog post complaining about streaming services and why Blu-Ray
and DVD is still cool).</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">Anyway, I condemn the PS5 to
the 'Tech Bin' and I'm going off to CeX to buy an original PS3. It will not
disappoint.</font></b></p>
