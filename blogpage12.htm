entertainment experience and also the best console ever made (in my opinion,
please don't kill me) Again, I'll talk about this stuff later but now I'll go
onto the main bit-</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial"><b>MiniDisc is a format quite a
few people have talked about and it's pretty easy to see why. CD quality audio*</b>
<b>with the convenience of a cassette tape, <i>and</i> editable table of
contents with </b><b>complete rewritability? From what it boasts, it should have
exploded in popularity. Unfortunately, it didn't exactly do that (at least in
the West). Thanks to our <i>good friends</i> the record labels (and the RIAA)
with their previous war against Digital Audio Tape, MiniDisc's launch in the
West was pretty poor.</b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial"><b>Fast forward 25 years however
and you'll find people still using MiniDisc out of love and nostalgia. I am one
of those people (despite not being alive in the 90s). I record and put together
mixtapes, I have a MiniDisc head unit for the car I'm getting 8 months from now,
I use an MD Walkman, the whole 9 yards.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial"><b>Something about the tactile
and engaging nature of recording each track, naming and ordering them, then
enjoying them feels a lot more fun than just streaming music (I don't actively
use Spotify or similar services, but still)</b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">And the <i>discs</i>. Good
Lord some of these look actually amazing. Thankfully due to the 90s and 2000s
design culture there are countless different designs for the minidiscs
themselves and they're just beautiful to look at. The Sony Bianca and Neige line
come to mind, but the TDK </font></b><i><font face="Comic Sans MS">wa<b> </b></font></i><b><font face="Arial">look
great too. I now own about 35 discs (lots of 10 discs are pretty cheap on eBay)
and </font></b><b><font face="Arial">regret nothing about my unhealthy money
management.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><img border="0" src="images/Sony%20Bianca%20front.JPG" width="312" height="209"><img border="0" src="images/Sony%20Bianca%20back.JPG" width="317" height="209"></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><i><font face="Arial">(Above: Sony Bianca
recordable MD)</font></i></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><i><font face="Arial">(Below: Sony Colour
Collection recordable MD, sealed. The Japanese text at the top reads </font>MD&#12399;&#12477;&#12491;&#12540;&#12363;&#12425;&#12399;&#12376;&#12414;&#12387;&#12383;<font face="Arial">,
meaning roughly 'MiniDisc started from Sony'. I'm still learning Japanese :D)</font></i></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><img border="0" src="images/MD%20colour%20front.JPG" width="312" height="208"><img border="0" src="images/MD%20colour%20back.JPG" width="312" height="208"></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">There's something about the
size and designs of MD that delights me. Not to mention, they actually sound
pretty good!&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">This is where that little
asterisk on the 'CD quality audio' bit comes in. MiniDiscs are much smaller than
CDs yet hold the same length of audio, if not more? in the 'same quality'? How
is this sorcery possible? The answer lies in the compression algorithm. You
remember MP3, that groovy way of compressing audio making internet transfer
easier?&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">Sony has a similar algorithm
called ATRAC. It works by finding areas of the spectrum of sound deemed
inaudible to the human ear, and removing them to save storage space as well as
general compression of audio. Despite it sounding </font></b>(no pun intended)<b><font face="Arial">
like the end result will sound bad, it actually sounds just as good to my ears
(and to a lot of people, too) while managing to compress quite well onto
MiniDisc.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial"><b>When recording directly from
an optical input </b><i>(using TOSLINK, which for those who don't know
essentially sends digital audio over optical fibre cables, negating potential
audio hissing and interference that exist with analog audio)</i><b> You can get
an absolutely wonderful listening experience with MiniDisc.</b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial"><b>For those thinking of getting
into MiniDisc I'd recommend looking into an MD Walkman with recording
functionality. Unless you just want to play prerecorded discs the thing you'll
be primarily doing is making your own, whether it's putting an album onto a
disc, or making mixtapes.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><font face="Arial"><b>My Walkman is an MZ-R55 my
late grandfather bought in the 90s and it's going strong even now. Optical and
Analog line in, analog line out and mic+headphone ports, plus the remote is
super fun to use and clips onto a shirt collar or something.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p><img border="3" src="images/MZ-R55.JPG" width="409" height="272"></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">I'll talk about my Hi-Fi setup in further detail in
another blog post/video, since this one is getting pretty long.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">To conclude, MiniDisc is fun and music is more
enjoyable now because of it</font></b></p>
