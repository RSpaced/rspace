<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">SEO. You've heard it before.
Those SquareSpace adverts? 'Easiest way to optimise for SEO'. Actually, that
sentence doesn't make much sense considering SEO is an acronym for 'Search
Engine Optimisation' so it would become 'Easiest way to optimise for Search
Engine Optimisation', but no matter.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">Google's an interesting
company. On one hand you have the really cool part which innovates and has a
great work culture for employees (in some cases). On the other side of Google is
the corporate drywall with stickers plastered (no pun intended) all over it
consisting of things like 'AdSense', 'Data collection', 'The Future is AI large
language models', and 'SEO over valid information'.</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">I have to admit, Google
Search is horrifically terrible. Advertising has always been there but in recent
years it seems that companies have found ways to completely ruin valid search
results by doing enough bidding for the top search result. There's a reason SEO
is so important to tech companies, and it's because it means their website will
be seen first by potential consumers, meaning more revenue. So in all cases good
for the company. But it is not good, however, for the consumer.</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">Trying to look up tutorials,
for example, is difficult. Sometimes you find these random bot-generated
'how-to' guides for things where they just state the problem over and over
again, with no solution, then try to sell you their software service, etc. It's
not always Google's fault, more so the fault of companies who try their hardest
to optimise for SEO in the first place, but what has resulted is a completely
unusable at times search engine which constantly regurgitates
misinformation.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%"><b><font face="Arial">So what has Google done to
rectify this problem? Oh, but of course! As any budding executive at tech
companies will say at conferences and boardrooms across the globe, the solution
is generative AI. Artificial Intelligence. Google has their own, Gemini, and in
every respect it's literally the same thing as ChatGPT, but Google flavoured.
But you know what they decided to do? Force it as the first search result on
pretty much every Google search.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%" align="left"><b><font face="Arial">What Gemini does
is crawl the first few search results, and then try to answer your search with
an answer comprising of the aformentioned sources. Now this would be <i>great</i>
if the top search results were valid and trusted sources of information, but
what do you think are the top search results as of now? SEO crap force-fed by
companies and Reddit comments. So what you often get is a completely incorrect
answer that the AI 'hallucinates' as correct.</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%" align="left"><b><font face="Arial">Now in terms of
most people, this isn't an issue. You can just scroll past and move on, finding
a good search result on the second page or so. But what about less tech-savvy
people who trust Google? If they look up 'What is a recommended diet for my
rock-climbing hobby', the AI will likely try and tell you that you should eat
2-3 rocks per day as a balanced diet. The source? Joke Reddit comments. I get
these are extremes but the very fact that it's possible for this to happen goes
to show that AI isn't taking over the world any time soon.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%" align="left"><b><font face="Arial">My favourite
description of AI is 'souped up predictive text', because in essence that's how
large language models work. They read a massive database of text crawled from
the internet, and combine words to form answers. The entire tech industry has
this fanaticism with shoehorning AI into everything they possibly can because it
'optimises' things. Correct me if I'm wrong, but is Copilot AI's inclusion in
Microsoft Teams for making homework assignments <i>really </i>necessary? I mean,
the average teacher most likely knows how to tell their students what to do for
homework, and certainly can do it fast enough that it isn't a chore or a
time-consuming process. So <i>why</i> does AI need to be in it? Simple.
Microsoft gets to say how many of their products is 'improved' by their Copilot
AI, meaning more investment.</font></b></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%" align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>I'm no economist
(and because of this fact please take my opinions with a pinch of salt), but it
seems like some form of AI bubble is and has been forming for a while now since
the initial ChatGPT craze began. The dot-com bubble became so big because of the
<i>potentials </i>of the World Wide Web, and investors were all-in on nearly
every single startup company that had any fleeting mention of </b></font><font face="Arial"><b>the
internet, no matter how absurd the proposition was (or if it was even possible).
AI seems to be going in this direction; not from the actions of consumers, but
more so the actions of tech companies that want to force it into every single
computerised thing possible.</b></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 120%" align="left"><font face="Arial"><b>To put it
simply: Not everything <i>needs</i> AI. It can be helpful at times but the very
fact that it's possible for AI models to 'hallucinate' (essentially come up with
a completely incorrect answer whilst having the utmost confidence that it is
not) means it can't be used as a reliable source of information. </b><b><i>Especially
</i>Google Search. Do we need to go back to Yahoo or Ask Jeeves?</b></font></p>

One of my favourite blogs to read is over at <a href="http://ludic.mataroa.blog">ludic.mataroa.blog</a>,
which has some of the best and most intriguing portrayals of what I've
complained about here regarding AI. Please read every single blog post he's ever made.)</font></i></p>
